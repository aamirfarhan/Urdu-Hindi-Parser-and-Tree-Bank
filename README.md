# Urdu-Hindi-Parser-and-Tree-Bank
A parser coded in python which gives us the frequency of a verb in a corpus and its arguments. It also tells us the tense, aspect and modality of a given verb.

The file verbFrames.py takes a directory as an argument. Then we type in the verb and it returns us the verb frames and its frequency throughout that directory.

The file ssfAPI.py takes in a directory and gives us the TAM information of each verb present in each sentence.
